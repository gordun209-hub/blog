# These are tools used by me for productive boost

## Editor

That part is easy, simply use vim for production boost. Other great editor is
GNU/Emacs but it's a GUI, you can use it inside terminal but that is not
recommended.
There is also [neovim](https://neovim.io/ "neovim's Homepage"), it's fork of vim
and integrated with **lua**
programming language. One can simply use a real programming language for
configuring neovim.

Hardest part when starting to use vim/neovim is keybindings. Simply write
:vimtutor inside editor and complete it 2 times a day. Once you feel familiar
with the commands inside tutorial. You can start using full time.

When you start using vim/neovim, you must install some plugins and there are
bunch of them so I will recommend the ones that I use.

- Telescope for *navigation*
- Fm for *using file managers inside terminal*
- nvim-lspconfig for *configuring language servers*
- mason for *installing language servers*
- Comment.nvim for *smart commenting*
- cmp for *auto complete*
- nvim-treesitter for *syntax highlighting*

I use 58 plugins so I can't list all of them in this blog. These are the most
importants.

## Terminal

I'm suckless fan for 2 week's so I use st (simple terminal) but you could also
use alacritty (written in rust). There is not much configuration for terminals
except themes cursor shapes etc so you can figure out.

## Shell

Zsh is my choice of shell because of It's POSIX compliant and feature rich if
you want to use those features. Don't use ~~~oh my zsh~~~ because it's bloated
af, There are other plugin managers like *zinit* or *antigen*, use those if you
want to use plugin manager. There are 3 must have plugins for zsh.
*zsh-auto-suggestions* *zsh-autocomplete* and *zsh-syntax-highlighting*
other than those, I configured my shell to use fzf for finding files or folders
easily. I wrote my own shell prompt so I can't suggest one.

## Terminal Multiplexer

There is only 1 terminal multiplexer that's popular so there is not much choice.
Its ***tmux***. If that's first time you hear the term `terminal multiplexer` It
simply handles multiple terminal sessions inside one terminal and there is also
buffers, windows and sessions but It's easy to getting used to. I definetly
recommend using a terminal multiplexer.

## Window Manager

I used most of the window managers and now using ***dwm*** for like 2 weeks. I
think best window manager depends on what language you know. If you like writing
c code, use dwm, if you like lua use *awesomewm* or *Xmonad* for haskell
enjoyers, if this is the first time you use window manager, you can start with
i3wm for simplicity and good documentation.


# These tools are boosted my productivity a lot so I you should use these too.

## will update in time that is not final form of this blog.
