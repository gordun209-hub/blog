Other great editor is GNU/Emacs but it\u0026rsquo;s a GUI, you can use it inside terminal but that is not recommended. There is also neovim, it\u0026rsquo;s fork of vim and integrated with lua programming language. One can simply use a real programming language for configuring neovim.\nHardest part when starting to use vim/neovim is keybindings. Simply write :vimtutor inside editor and complete it 2 times a day. Once you feel familiar with the commands inside tutorial. You can start using full time.\nWhen you start using vim/neovim, you must install some plugins and there are bunch of them so I will recommend the ones that I use.\nTelescope for navigation Fm for using file managers inside terminal nvim-lspconfig for configuring language servers mason for installing language servers Comment.nvim for smart commenting cmp for auto complete nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting I use 58 plugins so I can\u0026rsquo;t list all of them in this blog. These are the most importants.\nTerminal I\u0026rsquo;m suckless fan for 2 week\u0026rsquo;s so I use st (simple terminal) but you could also use alacritty (written in rust). There is not much configuration for terminals except themes cursor shapes etc so you can figure out.\nShell Zsh is my choice of shell because of It\u0026rsquo;s POSIX compliant and feature rich if you want to use those features. Don\u0026rsquo;t use oh my zsh because it\u0026rsquo;s bloated af, There are other plugin managers like zinit or antigen, use those if you want to use plugin manager. There are 3 must have plugins for zsh. zsh-auto-suggestions zsh-autocomplete and zsh-syntax-highlighting other than those, I configured my shell to use fzf for finding files or folders easily. I wrote my own shell prompt so I can\u0026rsquo;t suggest one.\nTerminal Multiplexer There is only 1 terminal multiplexer that\u0026rsquo;s popular so there is not much choice. Its tmux. If that\u0026rsquo;s first time you hear the term terminal multiplexer It simply handles multiple terminal sessions inside one terminal and there is also buffers, windows and sessions but It\u0026rsquo;s easy to getting used to. I definetly recommend using a terminal multiplexer.\nWindow Manager I used most of the window managers and now using dwm for like 2 weeks. I think best window manager depends on what language you know. If you like writing c code, use dwm, if you like lua use awesomewm or Xmonad for haskell enjoyers, if this is the first time you use window manager, you can start with i3wm for simplicity and good documentation.\nThese tools are boosted my productivity a lot so I you should use these too. will update in time that is not final form of this blog.
